My aim is to increase the speed at which we can create more Systematic Reviews. This repository does just that.

I will speak more about it in future :)

## Episode1: 

a simple classification task based on title of articles using Glove embedding (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and neural networks.
It shows us if each title is related to our systematic review goal or not.

the source of data:

                        "Automatic classification of literature in systematic reviews on food safety using machine learning"


## Episode2:

A RCT classification based on title; it decides whether a title indicates a randomized control trial or not.
